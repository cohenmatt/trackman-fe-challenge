# Initial thoughts

- Need a FE component library to make things easier. Bootstrap or MUI?
- I can use any styling so probably MUI because Iâ€™m most familiar
- Data persistence required - Redux?

**Component hierarchy plan**

- Page
    - Nav bar
        - Menu item
    - Facilities list
        - Create facility button
        - List
            - Card
                - Label
                - Button
                - Icon button
        - Delete facility dialog
    - Create / Edit facility
        - Input
        - Text area
